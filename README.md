# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Knowledge of Machine learning and Neural Network Model used to predict which non-profits will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Building the Deep Learning Model

Callback checkpoints that save the model's weights every 5 epochs.

## Optimization of the Deep Learning Model
- [AlphabetSoupCharity_optimization](https://github.com/MSF2141/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/6431928dd7091aab17bc3d5fdb8b7feabcda2ba2/Optimization/AlphabetSoupCharity_optimization.ipynb)
Python code for optimization of the model using three approaches
  - Noisy variables are formatted for binning
  - Additional hidden layers are added
  - Acivation function of output layer is changed for optimization

Callback checkpoints for the optimization of the deep learning model; it saves the model's weights every 5 epochs.

## Accuracy of the Deep Learning model
Slightly below 75%.
